          Welcome to OARE-Lite, an extension of the Old Assyrian Research
          Environment (OARE – /’ôrə/). This version offers almost 8000 published
          texts for viewing. OARE is focused on the documentary corpus of the
          Old Assyrian trade. The purpose of the database is to facilitate work
          with the Old Assyrian texts from the period of Kültepe Level II and
          Kültepe Level Ib. OARE is organized to record both textual and
          archaeological data, and expert observations arising from the
          interpretation of both sets of evidence. OARE is designed to
          facilitate collaborative research projects on the historical and
          archaeological record of the Old Assyrian trade and society through
          linguistic, lexical, economic, social, and other lenses.

            >Please be advised, we are still working out kinks. Most texts
            display nicely, but some do not. In addition, we are still auditing
            the data. Use transliterations and indexes at your own risk at this
            point. ***Many spellings listed in the lexicon (Words) are not
            attested and some are not even possible, a function of an earlier
            experimental effort.*** We hope to add feedback mechanisms soon so
            that users can mark texts that are misbehaving, or point out errors.
            In the meantime, please send any feedback to</em
