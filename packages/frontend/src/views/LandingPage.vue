          Welcome to a pre-release of OARE (pronounced /’ôrə/) at
          <a href="https://oare.byu.edu">oare.byu.edu</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website aims to offer published Old Assyrian texts for viewing,
          and eventually analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intended purpose of the database is to facilitate work with the
          Old Assyrian texts from the period of Kültepe Level II and Kültepe
          Level Ib. OARE is organized to record textual and expert observations
          arising from the interpretation, In this manner, it is intended
          eventually facilitate collaborative research projects on the
          historical and archaeological record of the Old Assyrian trade and
          society through linguistic, lexical, economic, social, and other
          lenses.

          The core OARE database is part of the Online Cultural and Historical
          Research Environment (OCHRE,
          <a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/ochre-data-service"
            >https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/ochre-data-service</a
          >).
        </p>
        <p>
          At present, only transliterations are available here. An initial
          onomasticon, lexicon, gazetteer, and temporal period index are in
          preparation for release as well. Asset and transaction index, and
          other indexes are planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sidebar search on the left prefers abbreviations used within the
          Old Assyrian specialist community (thus TC 2 instead of TCL 14) and
          only uses commas with reference to page numbers (thus TC 2 1 instead
          of TC 2, 1). Plans to make the searching more forgiving are in the
          works.

          <em>
            Please be advised, we are still working out kinks. Use
            transliterations at your own risk at this point. Many texts display
            nicely, but some do not. In addition, we are still auditing the
            data. Original transliterations of text published before roughly
            2008 arise from the Old Assyrian Text Project and sources drawn to
            create that project. Transliterations from more recent publications
            were checked within OARE/OCHRE, but some errors were introduced in
            converting to the format used for this database.</em

          At present, a traffic light symbol in front of the name of the text
          displays the current status of the transliteration. The vast majority
          are ‘yellow’ meaning the transliteration has not yet been checked.
          Hovering over the traffic light icon will indicate what the displayed
          icon means.

          Feedback mechanisms for also in development so that users can mark
          texts that are misbehaving, or point out errors. In the meantime,
          please send any feedback to
          <a href="mailto:oarefeedback@byu.edu">oarefeedback@byu.edu</a>.
