        oare.byu.edu is an ongoing project with the aim to becoming a valuable
        research environment for Old Assyrian Studies. The database is inspired
        by the Online Cultural Heritage Research Environment
        (ochre.uchicago.edu) but is a simplified, SQL implementation of some of
        the concepts developed there, with some particular tools developed
        specifically for editing cuneiform texts and the extension of projects
        involved in articulating the syntactic relationships of words, phrases,
        clauses, etc. and by extension, the persons, assets, transactions, and
        events they recorded.

        oare.byu.edu was organized and directed by Edward Stratford, Brigham
        Young University, but is the beneficiary of help from a great number of
        other individuals.

        Roughly half the published texts available on the website were first
        digitized by Karl Hecker and made available to the Old Assyrian Text
        project. Without his first efforts, this project would be far behind
        where it is now. Other members of the Old Assyrian Text Project also
        contributed to the accumulation of digitized forms of texts and deserve
        great thanks: Cecile Michele, Gojko Barjamovic, Guido Kryszat, Jan
        Gerrit Dercksen, Klaas Veenhof, Mogens Trolle Larsen, Thomas Hertel.

        Jonathon Hanna (BYU student) converted the OCHRE export into SQL and
        helped shepherd the post-conversion cleanup and SQL implementation of
        the dataset. Brett Fisher (BYU student, graduated) setting up the JS
        project, the AWS hosting arrangement, integration of the SQL and the
        first major iteration of the site. Harrison Bludworth (BYU student) has
        overseen the project starting summer 2021, and implemented numerous
        improvements, including the import and edit modules.
